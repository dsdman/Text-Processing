ANALYSIS:
Running the program produced around 150k tokens for the COCA data set and
around 50k tokens for the student data set. Both data sets had 20 documents in
it. Also of importance is the fact that the program didn't remove punctuation, 
which would also increase the overall token count. Overall, the ratio of COCA
to STUDENT raw data is around 3:1. The program calculated the results given by
first counting the raw verb counts in both data sets, and then dividing the
result by total number of tokens normalized by a thousand.

Examining the results reveals a number of differences and similarities. The
most obvious difference is that the COCA data set tends to use formal diction,
like "demonstrated", "reported", "determine", and "considered". The student
data set, by contrast, uses more simple words like "see", "says", "feel", and
"said". Both data sets use common diction like "found", "showed", or "see".

To conclude, the differences between the COCA and Student data sets give a
good picture of what kind of writing is done by both groups. From these
results, it can generally be deduced that the articles
written in the COCA corpus are more formal than the student essays.
