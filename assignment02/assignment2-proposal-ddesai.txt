CSCE 578 Assignment 2 Proposal

After weighing all the options, Option Four has the most potential to me. More specifially, I will be 
looking at two POS taggers, NLTK and Stanford, and after running each of them on the same data set, will observe 
the differences between them. The goal is to understand how each POS tagger tags words differently and to maybe
figure out how each of these programs could be improved.

The procedure would likely involve running each of the POS taggers on the same large set of data (maybe COCA or similar) 
and dump the output of each of them into individual files. Next, I will go through each word one by one (maybe after-
alphebetically sorting them for clarity) and see how each tagger has tagged it. For example, maybe NLTK has tagged
some word as a noun while Stanford has tagged the same word as a verb. Each word with a differing tag will be
written in an output file, which will contain the list of words, the POS that Stanford tagged it, and the POS that
NLTK tagged it.

The analysis will focus on any significant differences observed between the taggers. I will do this by hand,
singling out notable words/phrases with different POS taggings. From these,I will be able to see which of these POS 
taggers were able to successfully tag the word (or maybe neither), see which one was closer in the actual POS if
neither, and maybe offer insight as to how each POS tagger could be improved, cases in which one tagger is 
preferable to the other, etc.
