INTRODUCTION:
This is a program that analyzes student essay data and generates clusters of topics based on
their contents. This was done by calculating the TF-IDF (Term frequency and Inverse Document Frequency)
and then running a kmeans algorithm on the resulting matrix to generate clusters based on centroids.
The algorithm is run several times until the centroids converge towards an optimal solution.

METHODOLOGY:
In order to prepare the dataset, all other data except the 2014 student data (last folder) was removed.
Then, all drafts were removed from the dataset. The dataset was then stored in './data/Datastudent'

The following procedure is used by the main program ('main.py'):
1. Get the list of documents in the corpus by reading from the files.
   strip punctuation from each line, then add each word was to
   the document (represented as a string), and then each document to the corpus.
2. Vectorize the data by calculating the tf-idf for each term (feature) in the document.
   scikit-learn was used to assist in this.
3. Run kmeans (scikit-learn) to generate clusters. For the model to be accurate, experiment with
   different number of clusters, centroid orders, and iterations of the algorithm until results
   are optimal. For this data set, 5 clusters with 15 features were generated after running kmeans
   through 100 iterations.
4. Write the output of '3' (list of features in each cluster) in a file called 'results.txt'.

RESULTS:
The five clusters are stored in 'results.txt'. See 'Analysis.txt' for more details.
