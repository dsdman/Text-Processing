CSCE 578 Assignment 3 Proposal

Out of all the options, I think option one has the most potential for me.
Trying to cluster or categorize the student papers looks to be a 
interesting and challenging task. In order to do this, I will have to run 
tf-idf on the papers, vectorize them (after normalizing), and then do a metric like cosine 
similarity in order to attempt to group them. I will then look at the variance
of this metric and use that to group them into categories. I may do parts of this
project from scratch instead of libraries, as I've learned from project 2
that some of these libraries may be less reliable than others. I may then verify 
the result using a library that has TF-IDF built in. The analysis will likely 
involve me looking at the clusters that the program calculated from the student papers
and seeing how accurate they are.
